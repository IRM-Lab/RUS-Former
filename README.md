# visual_servo_transformer_track
We propose a novel visual servo Transformer-based robotic control network for carotid ultrasound scanning, termed RUS-Former. By integrating carotid segmentation with a multimodal visual servo Transformer control model, it achieves end-to-end automated scanning from image feature extraction to robotic motion control.
