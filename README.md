# visual_servo_transformer_Tracking
We propose a novel visual servo Transformer-based robotic control network for carotid ultrasound scanning, termed RUS-Former. By integrating carotid segmentation with a multimodal visual servo Transformer control model, it achieves end-to-end automated scanning from image feature extraction to robotic motion control.The corresponding video is now available on YouTube-click here to watch-
"While the paper is currently in review, the corresponding code will be made open-source immediately after acceptance, in line with open science practices."
